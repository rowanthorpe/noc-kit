POSIX shell script to quickly zero-out good sectors (only) on a failing disk.

  * specify datetime to resume previous invocation of that instance
    (format: %Y_%m_%d-%H_%M_%S)

DESCRIPTION:

 Zero Failing Disk (zfd) is a POSIX shell script to quickly zero-out good
 sectors on a failing disk while efficiently skipping bad sectors (to avoid
 triggering hardware bad-sector reallocation). It is most useful for server
 administrators returning failing disks under warranty, who wish to protect
 their clients' privacy. It does up to three zeroing passes, at three
 increasing levels of thoroughness:

 1) fast: merely skipping any clusters of sectors which have a problem
 2) splitting: splits problem clusters of sectors into good and bad sectors
 3) retrying: retries reading each bad sector two more times

 * Practically there is almost never any point to the third pass, as you want
   to avoid writing to a sector which even has the potential to be "bad" at
   the time of writing, so the third pass is disabled by default.
 * It must be run as root for low-level access to the disk.
 * Everything is interruptible/resumable as long as you leave the log-files in
   place.

 ZFD uses GNU ddrescue to do the heavy-lifting.

TODO:

 * Handle more POSIX systems for on-the-fly downloading of ddrescue (presently
   only Debian based systems are dealt with).

 * Use blktool, hdparm, raw devices, etc to avoid readahead confusing things
   (for people which --direct doesn't work for?).

 * Allow more fine-tuned handling of permissions, rather than just running the
   whole script as root.
